(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))

If b is positive the + operator will be used in a-plus-abs-b and the function will execute (+ a b). If b is negative however the if will spit out the - operator and (- a b) will be executed, which given that b is negative or zero is equivalent to (+ a (abs b)) with abs being an operator yielding the absolute value of b.
