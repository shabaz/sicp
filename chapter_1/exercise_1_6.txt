While Scheme normally evaluates in applicative order, the if statement will only evaluate the predicate statement at first and only then the appropriate consequent or alternative. With this new-if you do not get this behaviour, which means that the then clause and the else clause will always be evaluated, regardless of what the predicate evaluates to. This means that in all cases the else clause with the recursive call to sqrt-iter will be evaluated, which means the procedure gets stuck in an infinte loop. Even when the predicate starts to evaluate to false, the else clause still gets evaluated.
